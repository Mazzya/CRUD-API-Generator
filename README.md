![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Maintained%3F-yes-green.svg?)

Generate CRUD APIs with this powerful and simple CLI program. Currently, this program allows to generate APIs with the following microframeworks :
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
* [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) 

This program uses a specific file organization for API generation when using Flask : 

    MyAPI/
            â””â”€â”€ app/
                â”œâ”€â”€ routes.py
                â”œâ”€â”€ app.py
                â””â”€â”€ run.py

#### Explanation of the different files for API generation with Flask :

`app` :  This file allows you to configure the global Flask object

`routes` : This file contains all the API logic (routes, etc...)

`run` : This file allows you to run the API

### How to generate an CRUD API ?
Generating an API with this program is really easy. Let's see how to do it !

#### Requirements
```
Python 3
```
It is assumed that you have already installed the framework for which you are going to generate the API.
#### Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Mazzya/CRUD-API-Generator-DEV.git
```
If you wish, you can download the project directly [here](https://github.com/Mazzya/CRUD-API-Generator/releases)
#### Optional arguments
```
-h, --help            show this help message and exit
--flask               Generate a CRUD API with Flask
--fastapi             Generate a CRUD API with FastAPI
-v, --version         Check current version
-p PATH, --path PATH  Path where the API will be generated
```
### Examples
Let's see how to generate an API with Flask and FastAPI.
#### Generate an API with Flask
If you wish to generate an API without specifying the directory :
```bash
$ generator.py --flask
```
If you want to generate an API in a specific directory :
```bash
$ generator.py --flask -p "C:\Users\HP\Documents"
```
#### Generate an API with FastAPI
If you wish to generate an API without specifying the directory :
```bash
$ generator.py --fastapi
```
If you want to generate an API in a specific directory :
```bash
$ generator.py --fastapi -p "C:\Users\HP\Documents"
```
The functions are already available, the only thing left for you to do is to implement the logic and eventually add a database if you need to.
#### Issues
